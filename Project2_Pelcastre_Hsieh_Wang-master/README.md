* Data Analysis
	* _Project 2 Data Analysis.ipynb_ - All of our code and work to create graphs for analysis is in this file

* Datasets
	* _DSNY_Graffiti_Tracking.csv_ - Our main dataset our whole project is based around
	* _NYC_Census_Info.csv_ - A secondary dataset from the census to help some analysis in understanding other factors
	* _PulledCensusData.csv_ - Working with the original census dataset, we discovered all the values were strings so we created a copy where we manually changed values to be better manipulable
