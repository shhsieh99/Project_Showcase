    "---\n",
    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively **dense** (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively **sparse** (represented as a **bag-of-words**). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "1. Comment your code.\n",
    "1. All graphs should have titles, label for each axis, and if needed a legend. It should be understandable on its own.\n",
    "1. All code must run on colab.research.google.com\n",
    "1. You should not import any additional libraries.\n",
    "1. Try and minimize the use of the global namespace (meaning keep things in functions).\n",

    "**Why doesn't k-Nearest Neighbors work well for this problem?**\n",
    "k-Nearest Neighbors does not work well for this problem because with k-nearest neighbors, we want to be working with more unique data points than non-unique data points. In our dataset however, we see alot of overlap with words so finding a k value that gives predictions of neighbors and distances would be difficult and inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why doesn't Logistic Regression work as well as Naive Bayes does?**\n",
    "Though logistic regression does better than k-nearest neighbors, naive bayes still is the better model here than logistic regression. One reason could be that since there is a correlation of words with context, naive bayes better fits this bias compared to the linear component of logistic regression. Also, referring back that there is a lot of overlap with words, we can infer that there is a lot of noise that makes it harder to use logistic regression.\n",

    "**What is the relationship between logistic regression's sum of squared weights vs. C value?**\n",

Other than that, for it was not surprising to see a higher weight for the topic where the word was taken from, but it was a bit surprising to see the super low numbers (almost all in the negatives) for the weights of that word in other topics. However, looking at the word and its relevence to other topics does make sense why the weights would be lower. For example, using \"the space\" would clearly be more fitting in the sci.space topic and thus have a high weight whereas this bigram would not be used much in other topic contexts, thus lower weights."

    "### Question 6: L1 and L2 regularization\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, **L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features**. For this reason, we can use it as a way to do \"feature selection\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For several L1 regularization strengths ...\n",
    "  1. Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.\n",
    "  1. Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary . For this new model, use an **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  \n",
    "  1. Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "1. Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "1. How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* No need to apply pre-processing from question 5.\n",
    "* Train on the transformed (i.e. CountVectorizer) training data.\n",
    "* Evaluate on the transformed development data (using the CountVectorizer instance you trained on the training data).\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l1\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L1 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001).\n",
    "* (solver=\"liblinear\" might be needed for it not to crash)"

    "**Explain what the R ratio describes.**\n",

    "A big mistake that is being made is the misclassification of documents due to the uneven weighted importance of specific words to a topic and ambigious words that may be more heavily weighed depending on context. A way to fix the problem of ambigious words without looking at context might be to omit the word temporarily to determine if the document can be labeled better. For example, the topics \"alt.atheism\" and \"talk.religion.misc\" might seem similar due to their topics on religion so taking out words like \"Catholics\" or \"God\" or \"Morman\" to determine the document without the bias might be better."
