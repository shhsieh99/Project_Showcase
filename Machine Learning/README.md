# Machine Learning
5 different projects to better understand machine learning concepts, including KNN and Naive Bayes. The "Facial Keypoints" project was the final project created from scratch to assess facial keypoints on a given image using machine learning ideas. The other 4 projects in this folder are used to learn concepts.
