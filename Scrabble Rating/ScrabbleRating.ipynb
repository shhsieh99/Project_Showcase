    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes information about ~73,000 Scrabble games played by three bots on Woogles.io: BetterBot (beginner), STEEBot (intermediate), and HastyBot (advanced). The games are between the bots and their opponents who are regular registered users. You are using metadata about the games as well as turns in each game (i.e., players' racks and where and what they played, AKA gameplay) to predict the rating of the human opponents in the test set (test.csv). You will train your model on gameplay data from one set of human opponents to make predictions about a different set of human opponents in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is metadata for each game (games.csv), gameplay data about turns played by each player in each game (turns.csv), and final scores and ratings from BEFORE a given game was played for each player in each game (train.csv and test.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a game played on woogles.io: https://woogles.io/game/icNJtmxy. Use the \"Examine\" button to replay the game turn-by-turn.\n",

    "- **move** Tiles the player laid (NA for games in the test set; \"--\" if the turn_type was \"Pass\"; \"(challenge)\" if the turn_type was \"Challenge\"; \"-\" plus tiles exchanged if the turn_type was \"Exchange\"; at the end of the game, remaining tiles in a player's rack are in parentheses)\n",
    "- **points** Points the player earned (or lost) in their turn\n",
    "- **score** Player's total score at the time of the turn\n",
    "- **turn_type** Type of turn played (\"Play\", \"Exchange\", \"Pass\", \"Six-Zero Rule\" (i.e., a game that ends when players pass 3 turns in a row each), \"Challenge\")\n",
