# Scrabble-Rating

Using metadata about the games as well as turns in each game (i.e., players' racks and where and what they played, AKA gameplay), I predicted the rating of the human opponents in the test set (test.csv). I trained the model on gameplay data from one set of human opponents to make predictions about a different set of human opponents in the test set.
